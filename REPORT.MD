## 1.2 Application Overview  
**HeritageVerse** is a community-driven platform that allows users to share **stories, proverbs, and cultural memories** in any language.  

The **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** focused on:  
- Accepting text input from users (stories/proverbs).  
- Detecting the language automatically.  
- Generating **audio output** using gTTS.  
- Creating a **visually appealing story card** with the submitted text.  
- Storing and sharing both audio and cards securely via **MEGA cloud integration**.  

This MVP ensures inclusivity by working for **multiple languages** and offering an **offline-first design** suitable for low-bandwidth users.  

---

## 1.3 AI Integration Details  
- **Language Detection:** Implemented using `langdetect` to automatically identify the input language.  
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Integrated via **Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS)** for generating high-quality audio in the detected language.  
- **Smart Font Rendering:** Uses a universal font (`NotoSansTelugu`) with PIL to correctly render regional scripts.  
- **Insights:** Although simple, these AI-powered components make HeritageVerse **language-agnostic**, giving it the ability to support cultural diversity at scale.  

---

## 1.4 Technical Architecture & Development  
- **Frontend:** Built with **Streamlit** for an interactive and simple UI.  
- **Backend:**  
  - Handles language detection (`langdetect`).  
  - Generates audio (`gTTS`).  
  - Produces story cards (`PIL`).  
- **Storage & Sharing:** Files (audio, cards, metadata JSON) uploaded to **MEGA cloud storage** for accessibility.  
- **Metadata Tracking:** Stories stored in `stories.json`, maintaining name, text, language, timestamp, and file URLs.  
- **Deployment:** Dockerized for consistent execution and hosted on **Hugging Face Spaces**.

## 1.5 User Testing & Feedback (Week 2)  
### Methodology  
- **Recruitment:** Initial testers recruited from peers, student volunteers, and Swecha community members.  
- **Tasks Given:**  
  - Submit short stories or proverbs in native languages.  
  - Test app on **low-bandwidth internet**.  
  - Download and share story cards/audio.  
- **Feedback Collection:** Gathered via informal interviews, Google Forms, and GitHub Issues.  

### Insights  
- UI was intuitive, but testers requested **faster processing**.  
- Some languages produced poor-quality audio (gTTS limitations).  
- Users liked the **aesthetic story cards** and ability to share them.  
- Requests came for **voice input** and **mobile-first design**.  

### Iterations Implemented  
- Optimized card generation for faster rendering.  
- Improved error handling for unsupported languages in gTTS.  
- Simplified download process for audio/cards.

## 1.6 Project Lifecycle & Roadmap  

### A. Week 1: Rapid Development Sprint  
- Set up GitHub repo & Streamlit app.  
- Built MVP with language detection, TTS, and story card generation.  
- Integrated MEGA cloud storage for persistence.  
- Deployed initial app to Hugging Face Spaces.  

**Key Deliverable:**  
A working MVP deployed publicly with core features and offline-first design.  

---

### B. Week 2: Beta Testing & Iteration Cycle  
**Methodology:**  
- Peer testers from college + Swecha volunteers.  
- Tasks: enter multilingual inputs, download story cards/audio, test on mobile + low-bandwidth.  
- Feedback logged via Google Forms and GitHub Issues.  

**Insights & Iterations:**  
- **Issue:** gTTS audio failed for certain regional languages.  
  - **Fix:** Added fallback handling.  
- **Issue:** Large text wrapping in story cards.  
  - **Fix:** Dynamic resizing + wrapping with PIL.  
- **Issue:** MEGA upload delays.  
  - **Fix:** Improved temporary storage and error retries.
